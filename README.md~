**Sorting algorithms & Big O**
> **Description**

The purpose of this project is to learn about some of the most common algorithms as well as explore concepts of calculating the BigO notation. Some of the most common algorithms covered by this repository are:
> * Bubble sort
> * Insertion sort
> * Selection sort
> * Quick sort

**Requirements**
> * Linux (Recommended)
> * gcc(>= 4.8.4)
> * Logic File, Header, Main Files

**Added Notes:**

> * All logic code that requires checking by the Holberton checker must be located at the root of the repository.
All main files offered by the intranet are located in the main_files/ directory.
All logic code must adhere to the Betty C style format.
The use of standard library functions is strictly prohibited unless specified.
All prototypes and structs must be located in the 'sort.h' file and must be guarded.
All tasks given require an extra text file containing the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line: 
in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
